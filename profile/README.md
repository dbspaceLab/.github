# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview
This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing model-centric strategies for effective, efficient, ethical, and just neuromodulation.

This is a **weekend lab** meant to be an informal collaborative space for model-centric approaches to adaptive DBS.
You'll see a whole bunch of projects that we'd *love* for you to try your ideas on and contribute to.

All the projects here will be opensource, freely available for all-time - the goal is bring DBS out into the *open science* framework.
Read more about the overarching philosophy in the [organization wiki](https://github.com/dbspaceLab/.github/wiki/dbspaceLab-Wiki).
