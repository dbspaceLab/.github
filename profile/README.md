# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview
This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing model-centric strategies for effective, efficient, ethical, and just neuromodulation.

The DBSpace Lab is a **weekend lab** focused on doing cool, creative science without academic bloat.
This is a bit of an experiment, so let's make sure it's fun, above all.

### Goals
Science is the inference of generative distributions using, in some way, data to keep models aligned to reality. 
Everything else is in service to that or noise.
This lab is an effort to refocus on science and discard, wholesale, the noise.

### Principles

The core principles of the lab are straightforward:
* Community > Technology
* Education >> Production
* Exploration > Operationalization

## Projects
The main project of this organization is ```dbspace```, a Python library for model-centric analysis of clinical electrophysiology in DBS.
Since clinical applications are always in dynamic, highly-variable settings, and measurement is always messy, we need models to guide adaptive neuromodulation.

## Why the name?
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates the brain's state, and most-likely its accessible statespace.
Also I wanted to be an astrophysicist growing up, so the name seemed to honor that.
