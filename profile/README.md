# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview
This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing model-centric strategies for effective, efficient, ethical, and just neuromodulation.

This is a *weekend lab* meant to be an informal collaborative space for model-centric approaches to adaptive DBS.
You'll see a whole bunch of projects that we'd *love* for you to try your ideas on and report back.
