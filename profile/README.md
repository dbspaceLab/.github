# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing model-centric strategies for effective, efficient, ethical, and just neuromodulation.

## Overview

This Github Organization is the primary (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```.
The main goal is to host unique, open datasets related to neuromodulation, particularly deep brain stimulation (DBS), and foster novel approaches to analysing them.
Particular emphasis will be placed on *small-data*, *control theoretic*, and/or *applied mathematical* approaches that are otherwise underappreciated in the funded sphere.

This is a **weekend lab** meant to be an informal collaborative space for model-centric approaches to adaptive DBS.
You'll see a whole bunch of projects that we'd *love* for you to try your ideas on and contribute to.

### FOSS
All the projects here will be open source, freely available for all-time - the goal is bring DBS into a *public science* framework.
Importantly, derivative works should also stay in the public space - this will be reflected in the licensing.

Read more about the overarching philosophy in the [organization wiki](https://github.com/dbspaceLab/.github/wiki/dbspaceLab-Wiki).

## Workshops
There's no learning like group-learning.
We'll set up a schedule for periodic workshops where we talk through some of the foundational engineering principles of DBS alongside hands-on notebooks.
Community is always the driver of progress, and DBS is no exception.
