This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing

## Overview
The DBSpace Lab is a **weekend lab** focused on doing cool, creative science without academic bloat.
This is a bit of an experiment, so let's make sure it's fun, above all.

## Principles
The core principles of the lab are straightforward:
* Community > Technology
* Education >> Production
* Exploration > Operationalization
* Science is the inference of generative distributions using, in some way, data to keep models aligned to reality. Everything else is in service to that or noise.

## Projects
The main project of this organization is ```dbspace```, a Python library for model-centric analysis of clinical electrophysiology in DBS.
We need models to understand how measurements relate to underlying dynamics.


## Why the name?
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates the brain's state, and most-likely its accessible statespace.
Also I wanted to be an astrophysicist growing up, so the name seemed to honor that.
