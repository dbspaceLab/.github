This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing

## Overview
The main project of this organization is ```dbspace```, a Python library for model-centric analysis of clinical electrophysiology in DBS.

We need models to understand how measurements relate to underlying dynamics.

## Why the name?
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) modulates the brain's state, and most-likely its accessible statespace.
Also I wanted to be an astrophysicist growing up, so the name seemed to honor that.
