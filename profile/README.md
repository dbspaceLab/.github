# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing model-centric strategies for effective, efficient, ethical, and just neuromodulation.

In the spirit of *citizen science*, this lab space is meant for everyone, no matter background or knowledge level.
The critical things are: a desire to learn, to ask bold questions, and to work towards a more democratic understanding of *clinical* neuroscience.

## Overview

This Github Organization is the primary (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, an effort that I started during my MD/PhD at Emory/GeorgiaTech.
My PhD work was mentored by a pioneer of psychiatric deep brain stimulation (DBS) and a wide spread of leading neuroscientists, psychiatrists, engineers, neurosurgeons, and psychologists.
That work has started getting published out there, but those analyses are just the tip of a massive iceberg.

The main goal for DBSpace is to host a unique, open dataset collected from a once-in-a-lifetime experiment, and foster novel approaches to analysing it.
Given the lack of institutional support given to *small-data*, *control theoretic*, and *applied mathematical* approaches in the DBS space, those will be prioritized here.

This is a **weekend lab** meant to be an informal collaborative space for model-centric approaches to adaptive DBS.
You'll see a whole bunch of projects that we'd *love* for you to try your ideas on and contribute to.

## Principles
We are a principle-driven group, and those principles are anchored in clinical medicine.
That means: people-first.

Some other principles that are foundational here:
* Patients, not Petri Dishes
* Math, not Measurements
* Precious Data is Precious
* Small-Data is More Ethical
* Democratizing Neuromodulation
* All Towards Justice

### FOSS
All the projects here will be open source, freely available for all-time - the goal is bring DBS into a *public science* framework.
Importantly, derivative works should also stay in the public space - this will be reflected in the licensing.

Read more about the overarching philosophy in the [organization wiki](https://github.com/dbspaceLab/.github/wiki/dbspaceLab-Wiki).

## Workshops
There's no learning like group-learning.
We'll set up a schedule for periodic workshops where we talk through some of the foundational engineering principles of DBS alongside hands-on notebooks.
Community is always the driver of progress, and DBS is no exception.
