This is the main (and virtual) space for ```DBSpace Lab```, a virtual lab focused on developing

## Overview
The main project of this organization is ```dbspace```, a Python library for model-centric analysis of clinical electrophysiology in DBS.

## Why the name?
DBS stands for deep brain stimulation, which is used as a treatment for severe neuropsychiatric illnesses.
It uses surgically implanted electrodes to deliver electrical currents into brain structures, currents that seem to improve a patient's clinical state.

One way DBS is thought to work is to modulate the *state* of the brain, maybe even the *statespace* of the brain.
Understanding how DBS changes this statespace in a way that alleviates symptoms needs more than.

So the name is meant to reflect a new way of seeing DBS as neuroengineering, an application of model-predictive control, meant to open up and/or guide the brain's space of possibilities.

But actually, it seemed like a cool way to honor my early career aspirations in astrophysics.
